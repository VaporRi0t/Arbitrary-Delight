# Arbitrary Delight

**Arbitrary Delight** expands on [Farmer's Delight Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) / [Farmer's Delight Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight) by adding **new meals, drinks, and ingredients** that blend seamlessly with both Farmer’s Delight and vanilla Minecraft.  
The goal is simple: **more variety, more immersion, without anything feeling out of place.**

This mod requires **Farmer’s Delight**. Using **JEI** (or another recipe viewer) is strongly recommended.
