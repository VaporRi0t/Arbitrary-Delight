Arbitrary Delight will add on to Farmer's Delight by adding more meals and drinks to cook, and craft.

This mod adds more meals to cook/craft using ingredients from Farmer's Delight and some more ingredients added in this mod. This mod was designed to closely fit in to Farmer's Delight and Vanilla Minecraft so nothing stands out to much. 

Arbitrary Delight requires Farmer's Delight, you can also use JEI for recipes.

## About
